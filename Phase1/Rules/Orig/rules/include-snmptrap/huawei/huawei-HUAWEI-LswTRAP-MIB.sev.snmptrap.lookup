#
# 1.0 - Initial Release.
#
#        Compatible with:
#
#          -  Netcool/Omnibus 3.6 and 7.x
#          -  Netcool Rules File Standards (MUSE-STD-RF-03, Jan 2006)
#
#          -  HUAWEI-LswTRAP-MIB
#
# 1.1 - Changed the format
#
###############################################################################
#
# Entries in a Severity lookup table have the following format:
#
# {<"EventId">,<"severity">,<"type">,<"expiretime">}
#
# <"EventId"> is defined in the Rules File.  In some cases it is necessary to
# add a modifier to the EventId to further clarify the condition.
#
# Valid values for <severity> are:
#   0 - clear
#   1 - indeterminate
#   2 - warning
#   3 - minor
#   4 - major
#   5 - critical
#   d - discard
#
# Valid values for <type> are:
#   1 - problem
#   2 - resolution, NOTE: resolution alarms MUST have a <severity> of 1.
#   11 - more severe
#   12 - less severe
#   13 - information
#
# <expiretime> is the number of seconds the event will remain in the
# ObjectServer before being automatically cleared. Alarms which should not
# expire MUST have <expiretime> set to 0 (zero).
