#
# 1.3 - Added basic debug logging.
#
# 1.2 - Modified the construction of $Header and reconstruction of $Details to
#       ensure better matching, and easier compatibility with syslog messages
#       received via SNMP traps (SYSLOG-MIB).
#
#     - Introduced the $CLARIFIER token which is to be assigned, if necessary,
#       in the facility-specific include files, and is added to @Identifier to
#       ensure accurate deduplication.
#
# 1.1 - Each individual Facility is now handled in a seperate include file for
#       which cisco-ios.include.syslog.rules is now the base file.
#
# 1.0 - Initial Release [INCOMPLETE].  
#
#     - Netcool Rules File Standards (MUSE-STD-RF-02, July 2002)
#
#     - Covers thru IOS 12.2.
